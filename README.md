# Noteful

An online app for creating notes organized into folders. First add the desired folder, then add your notes. Select the folder from the dropdown. Once added the note will appear either in the main list (activated by clicking the header), or in an individual list when you select a specific folder from the sidebar.

### Contibutors

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Contributors include David Bolin and fellow students, along with a relatively large portion of the original codebase provided by Thinkful.
